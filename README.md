# Backchair DB 

**A home-made database**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sandwwraith/backchair-db.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sandwwraith/backchair-db)

### Why?

1. Because I can.
2. Actually, implementing a database is a perfect way to understand how databases work.
3. It is a good project to try corner cases for Kotlin Multiplatform – I'm gonna make run this database on JVM, Native targets and probably Node.JS

> Why it is called 'backchair'? Because I'm writing this project at home sitting at it. Actually, a more poplar translation for 'кресло' is armchair, but my armchair doesn't have arm supporters, so I would call it backchair. Also it is a funny reference to CouchDB.

### What can it do?

For now, nothing. But you can use it as a nice template for Kotlin/Multiplatform setup of CLI tool (see `runJvm` and `runNative` tasks in root build.gradle)
